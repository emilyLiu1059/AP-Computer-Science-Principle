Assignment
Create a filter to transform digital images by programmatically manipulating pixels.
Pair Programming
Working in pairs, your task is to design and develop a program for filtering digital images. More specifically, you must use the Python programming language to code a program capable of systematically transforming an image by mathematically manipulating its bits. Your program must perform transformations on images programmatically, save the manipulated results, and allow users to customize the filters. How will your image filter program function? What image features, attributes, and representations will it transform, and how will it transform them? As you work through this module, continuously think about how the skills and knowledge you gain may apply to your project.
Submission
Your submission will be an original program coded with the Python language.
Your image filter program must:
Create three filters each of which manipulates the image at the pixel level. These filters must mathematically manipulate the RGB channels of each pixel. The mathematical calculation may NOT be one simple operation such as add, subtract, divide, or multiply. It may NOT be as simple as taking one of the colors out (setting the value to 0). The filters must be complex.
Of the three filters you create, two must incorporate user input into the code to create the filter.
Use Python constructs to accomplish these tasks, including:
creating functions
using selection (if/elif/else)
using iteration (while and for )
getting input
Use a list (or other collection type) to represent a collection of data (in this case, individual pixels of an image) that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the program’s purpose.
In addition, you will complete written responses that include:
a description of the overall purpose of the program,
a description of the program input and output,
two program code segments:
The first program code segment must show how data have been stored in the list.
The second program code segment must show the data in the same list being used, such as creating new data from the existing data or accessing multiple elements in the list, as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose.
a description of the name of the list being used,
a description of what the data contained in the list represents in your program,
an explanation of how the selected list manages complexity in your program code by explaining why your program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently if you did not use the list.
You will review one other group’s submission and reflect upon any differences from your own work.
Learning Goals
Over the course of this module and this project, you will learn to:
use a text-based programming language (Python)
use appropriate computer science terminology
represent color using the RGB color model
create vector and raster-based images
transform behaviors by manipulating underlying representations
create and modify digital audio
analyze the costs and benefits of encoding schemes
evaluate ethical practices related to digital media production, consumption, and ownership
